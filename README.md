# find-duplicate-steam-cards

Tiny script to find all duplicate trading cards in a Steam inventory. I made this since it's surprisingly poorly
documented online and most of the available tools fail very frequently.

If you run `find_duplicates.py` and enter your Steam ID, it should output all duplicate trading cards like so:

```
Duplicate items:
  2 copies of 'Mini Metro Trading Card': 'Montr√©al (Trading Card)'
  ...
```
